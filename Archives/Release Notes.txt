Release notes :


Version 1.011
-------------
Manage MIDI file without channel information
    Parameter => use_channel, False if channel = track, True if channel is used
Fix SW - still not working
Create new VBO, TP - Texture Paint
    Paint a wall following notes appears
Simplify complex code to be under max-complexity = 15 (flake8)
VBO LT improved
Animate pitchbend wheel and aftertouch
    with custom attributes values on model/principal object for the channel => self.note_object[128]
Animate control_change
    pan = > custom attributes values => self.note_object[128]
    


Version 1.010
-------------
New visual Blender object (VBO) : SW - Splash Wall
    Launch ball of paint splashing on the Wall
    Color of ball indicate the note
    Location of impact indicate the octave
    Currently blocked by bug on metaballs. Ticket created in bug tracker T69578
Huge improvement for Tempo MAP
    Test with complex music (albinoni) with massives tempo changes (703)
Huge code cleaning - Using flake8 and blender recommandations
Remove all bpy.ops and go to low level when it's possible


Version 1.009
-------------
New visual Blender object (VBO) : FS - Foutain Solo
    Unique Fountain for all notes of channel
    Emitting only one BIG particule by note
        Note distinguished by the color of the object or other caracteristics
Use model object parameters for fountain


Version 1.008
-------------
Many changes to respect standard MIDI file 0 & 1 (SMF0 & SMF1)
    SMF0 is a particular SMF1 with only one track (track 0)
    SMF1 contain tracks (variable number) and each track contain channels
        The relation between channel and track is n to n
    Replace concept of track by channel everywhere
Better velocity Fountain react
    velocity is used to calculate the vertical speed of particles
Objects BG, FT, PB are now created via duplicate from model
    This is better in term of ram and speed
Initial position improved for BG, LT, FT
Using vector for animate object location instead of fixed values
Setting custom properties for velocity, aftertouch, pitchbend (using later)


Version 1.007
-------------
Manage JSON file with the same name as MIDI file. This file contain configuration for conversion from MIDI to Blender
Improve fountain animation :
    Use multiple particles settings with starting and ending for each emitter instead of using keyframes. Very lighter.
Use random color for all object model


Version 1.006
-------------

Visualization type light = LT - Design for multi note
Visualization type fountain = FT - Particle emitting
Support for MIDI file type 0 added
Empty parent placing improved
Use of keyframe_insert(data_path='xxxxxxxx', frame=frame) instead of setting frame and modifier separately


Version 1.005
-------------

Visualization type light = LT - Design for mono note
Major cleaning and namming
Code PEP8 conformation (Except some code E501 : line too long)


Version 1.004
-------------

Visualization type grid = GD
Using collection with more accuracy
Add parent to each track
Have MIDI file for testing. Type 0, 1 and 2


Version 1.003
-------------

First class implementation
Use the framerate choosing in Blender GUI
Load file.mp3 if exist in Video Sequencer editor
BG grow from the ground now
Code cleaning - Use of PEP8 naming convention
Code PEP8 conformation (Except some code E501 : line too long)


Version 1.002
-------------

Use of Visual Studio Code (VSC) instead of included blender text editor
Use of Blender Development in VS Code created by Jacques Lucke (version [0.0.12] - 2019-04-24)
Code redesign (a little) to be able to run in this environnement
Code cleaning


Version 1.001
-------------

Generate simple cubes animation from midifile
From on midifile in input animate sets of cubes, one cube by note
Manage note animation following the midi event note_on/note_off and accordingly to the tempo
Master tempo for type 1 midifile
Limitation :
    Only type 1 midifile is supported
