ToDO list :

-   Correct bpy.ops for
    - add_mball(collect, name_of_mball, material, x, y, z, emp_par):
    - add_pb(collect, name_of_pb, material, x, y, z, emp_par):
    - Channel_is_FT():
    - Channel_is_FS():

-   Continue on add_VBO to replace cylinder, uvsphere, icosphere

-   For all object creation, give size
-   Need synhro to FS vizualisation between Ball impact and Target scale change
-   Clean scene before create anything
    -   Remove default cube is the minimum
    -   Clean all orphans is the maximum
    -   Place Blender into Object_Mode
-   Manage MIDI file type 2 (done for 0 and 1)
    -   type 0 = Mono track
        -       note_on and note_off have an additionnal parameter for the channel
        -       This channel mean track
    -   type 1 = Multitrack Synchronous
    -   type 2 = Multitrack Asynchronous
-   Animate a bones set
-   Manage somes specifics properties for each type of visualization. Class overheading ?
    -   Exemple : 
        -   for BG, we must know, the placement, orientation, etc.
        -   same for GRID
        -       same for light, color, size ?
-   Improve the code for create cube, empy, grid, and so on. Check the remark in code
    -   Try to not use b_ops    
-   Imagine other visualizations like :
    -   An object like a box who reject an other object via particule at each note
        -   Another fountain with one big particule emitted for each note
        -   This particule can have propertie changing accordingly with note
            -   ie : color, or text or anything else
    -   Shape modifier
    -   see after for other ideas
-   Transform this python script to addon
    -   With GUI for
        - selecting MIDI file
        - choose visualization and parameters by track
        - save all configuration (so load also)
-   Made a second video using the script
    -   Maybe with cycle
    -   Using all objects created
    -   With other skill in Blender such as, camera move, camera change, DOF, Light color and placement,atmosphere, smoke ?
    -   With proper MIDI file composed for this test


Ideas :

Apply variation by music to any parameters of any object with use of driver
For example : 
-    modifier variation
-    physic, like wind strenght
-    color of anything
-    anything on anything and why note on multiple things simultanously

Use set of variables preset

Type MV - variables

NOTE_x   mean note of track x
VELO_x   mean velocity of track x
BEAT_x   mean beat mesure of track x (why not ?)
